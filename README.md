# MNIST-multi-class-SVM
Second project as part of the "Neural Networks - Deep Learning" winter 2019 course. 

Implemented a multi-class SVM classifier for classification of the digits of the MNIST database. 

Since the course was taught in greek, the report for the project is written in greek as well.

Instructions: run from test.py
